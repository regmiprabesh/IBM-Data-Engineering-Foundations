## Extract, Transform, and Load Data using Python

## Overview

The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations play a pivotal role in the realm of a Data Engineer. A Data Engineer's primary task involves the extraction of data from various sources and diverse file formats, transforming this data according to predefined configurations, and finally, loading it into a database for subsequent processing. This aims to provide comprehensive practical experience in executing these vital ETL operations.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Reading and extracting data from CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
- **Data Transformation**: Performing necessary transformations on the extracted data to meet predefined formatting requirements.
- **Data Loading**: Saving the transformed data into a ready-to-load format suitable for integration into a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

## Key Steps

1. **Read Different File Types**: Utilize Python libraries to read and access data from CSV, JSON, and XML files.
2. **Extract Relevant Data**: Extract required data subsets from the various file types for subsequent processing.
3. **Transformation Phase**: Transform the extracted data into the specified format to meet predefined settings and configurations.
4. **Data Preparation**: Save the transformed data in a format optimized for easy loading into an RDBMS.

## Learnings from this chapter :

- Proficiency in handling diverse data file formats using Python.
- Hands-on experience in performing Extract, Transform, and Load operations.
- Ability to execute data transformation procedures tailored for specific requirements.
- Preparedness to load transformed data into a relational database for further analysis and utilization.
